# 1. Metadata File (metadata.txt)
Create a metadata.txt file with sample IDs and their corresponding condition (e.g., healthy control vs. disease). Structure it as follows:

SampleID    Condition
Sample1     Control
Sample2     Control
Sample3     Disease
Sample4     Disease




# 2. Count Matrix File (counts.txt)
Your counts.txt file should contain raw count data with genes as rows and sample IDs as columns. Structure it as follows:

GeneID    Sample1    Sample2    Sample3    Sample4
GeneA     100        150        120        130
GeneB     200        250        210        220
